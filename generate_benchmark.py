--------------------------------

Prompt used to generate the script (also describes quite accurately what the script does):

Generate a python script and provide a sample config yaml file. The script should integrate the logic of the script below as a first step, and then add additional
steps, as described below. After each step, the script should print the intermediate benchmark into a tsv file in
subdirectory "intermediate_benchmarks" with a name that reflects the step that was just completed. The final output
should be a tsv file in the root directory with the name specified by the user in the --output argument.
Also, the script should take notes on error statistics and counts of items in the benchmark after each step, and print
the statistics after each step, and at the end of the script.

The steps to be implemented are as follows:
- 0.step: load a config file in yaml format that specifies further settings of the benchmark:
    - name of the method to be used for sorting the distractor pool by difficulty (to be applied in step 2)
    - number of options to be included in each question
    - NOTA text ("none of the other options is correct")
    - whether to add NOTA as one of the options
    - list of submodalities to be included in the current version of the benchmark, specified by the name of the file
      ("audio.mastermix.wav", "image.pdf", "symbolic.musicxml")
    - desired percentage of NOTA-correct questions in the benchmark
    - labels to be added to the options (e.g., "(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)")
    - seed for random sorting (to ensure reproducibility, use the seed right at the beginning of the script)
    - the cmdline args of the script below, to be used for step 1 (e.g., paths to the meta-questions and pieces files, and the python file containing the methods for ground truth and distractor pool extraction)
- 1.step: generate the product of meta-questions and pieces, and compute the ground truth and distractor pool for each
question-piece pair using the methods specified in the meta-questions file. This is the logic that is currently
implemented in the script below.
- 2.step: apply a method as specified in the config to sort the distractor pool for each question-piece pair (with
preliminary dummy implementation of the method that just shuffles the distractor pool, to be replaced later with a real
implementation). This method should be applied to each question-piece pair in the benchmark generated in step 1, the
distractors sorted should be added to a new column "sorted_distractors" and
the output should be saved in an intermediate benchmark file named "benchmark_distractors_sorted.tsv".
- 3.step: generate a product of the benchmark from the 2. step with the list of submodalities specified in the config
(excluding submodalities that are not part of any modality that is supported for the given question, as specified in
`modality_in_question` column in the meta-questions file), adding the submodality name as a new column "submodality", and the column "path_to_question_context_file", which would
be the concatenation of the piece directory (column "path" from pieces.tsv) and the submodality name. The output should
be saved in an intermediate benchmark file named "benchmark_with_submodalities.tsv".
- 4.step: for each question-piece-submodality triplet, generate the final options to be included in the benchmark:
    - if NOTA is to be included, take it (the text specified in config) as one of the options,
    - take the ground truth as one of the options,
    - and take the desired number of remaining options from the sorted distractor pool, in order of difficulty (e.g., if
      the desired number of options is 5 and both NOTA and ground truth are included, take the top 3 most difficult distractors from the
      sorted distractor pool, and if NOTA is not included, take the top 4 most difficult distractors from the sorted
      distractor pool).
    - add the ground truth to a new column "final_correct_option"
    - The final options should be added in a new column "final_options" as a JSON string (list of options), and the output should be saved in an intermediate benchmark file named "benchmark_with_final_options.tsv".
- 5.step: add questions where ground-truth is excluded from the options (NOTA is correct answer) - only if the
  percentage of such desired questions is non-zero:
    - compute the probability that a random item should be added with NOTA as the correct option, such that the final
      percentage of NOTA-correct questions in the benchmark is as specified in the config (e.g., if the desired
      percentage is 20%, the probability would be 25%, because if we add an item with NOTA as the correct option with
      25% probability, we would have 25% NOTA-correct items among the newly added items, and if we add these items to
      the existing benchmark where 0% of items are NOTA-correct, we would end up with 20% NOTA-correct items in the
      final benchmark).
    - for each item from the benchmark after step 4, witch probability computed in the previous step, add a new item to
      the benchmark where the options are:
        - NOTA text
        - the top (N-1) most difficult distractors from the sorted distractor pool 
    - the column "final_correct_option" is set to NOTA text. The output should be saved in an intermediate benchmark file named
      "benchmark_with_NOTA_correct_items_added.tsv".
- 6.step: 
    - first, sort the options alphabetically, and then sort them randomly
    - add labels to the options (e.g., "(A)", "(B)", "(C)", "(D)") as specified in the config
    - add column all_choices (Type: list of str): A list containing all valid choice identifiers (usually letters
      or numbers). Example: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']
    - add column index2ans (Type: Dict[str, str]): A dictionary mapping the choice identifiers to their actual textual
      content. Example: {'A': '10 cm', 'B': '15 cm', 'C': '20 cm', 'D': '25cm', 'E': 'none of the other options is
      correct'}
    - The options should be in a new column "labeled_final_options" as a JSON string (list of options with labels), and the
  correct option should be in a new column "labeled_final_correct_option".
    - save the output as the intermediate bechmark file named "benchmark_with_labeled_sorted_final_options.tsv".
- 7.step:
    - save the final output (the same) in a tsv file in the root directory with the name specified in the config (e.g.,
      "final_benchmark.tsv").
- 8.step:
    - print the  final statistics of the benchmark, including the total number of items, the number and percentage of NOTA-correct
  items, and any errors encountered during the process.

"""
Adjust the following script, such that before step 1, it would perform step 0 as described here:
- from generation config yaml, read the following variables:
    - questions_per_skill_count: 3 # number of questions to generate per skill (for the draft, we can keep it small, e.g. 10, and then scale up after analyzing the results and iterating on the question templates)
    - ontology_path: "ontology.yaml" # Add this to specify the path to the ontology file
        - sample content of ontology.yaml:
            order:
            - 1: "first"
            - 2: "second"
            - 3: "third"
            - end: "last"

            voice:
            - S: "soprano"
            - A: "alto"
            - T: "tenor"
            - B: "bass"

- load the tsv file with meta-questions (as it was previously in the step 1), with focus on the following fields:
    - meta-question_id
    - skill
    - text_with_wildcards (e.g., "What is the scientific pitch notation of the {order} {voice} note in the provided excerpt?")
    - question_keys (e.g. ["order", "voice"])

- for each unique skill, generate the desired number of question instances (as configured in questions_per_skill_count):
    - iteratively sample a random meta-question corresponding to the given skill, until the desired number is reached
    - for the meta-question, sample the values for the specified variables, from the allowed values as described in the
      ontology.yaml
        - e.g., for the question in the example, we may sample "voice": "S", and "order": 1.
    - create a `values` dict with the selected values (e.g. {"voice": "S", "order": 1}) - save to field `values`
    - replace the wildcards in the `text_with_wildcards` with the values from ontology yaml file to get the question text - save to field `question` (e.g., "What is the scientific pitch notation of the first soprano note in the provided excerpt?")
- so the new data will contain `questions_per_skill_count` * skill_count items. For each item, copy all the fields that were already in the meta-questions tsv file, and add the fields
- also after the step 0, print the statistics (similarly to other steps) and save as intermediate file
- the data output from step 0 would be the data input for step 1.

Further, adjust the step 1 to not only pass the path to the extraction_func, but also the `values`, because in the new implementation, extraction_func expects `path` and `values` dict.



(Additional)
Further, suggest a way to automatically control the number final benchmark items, such that in cases were full product is created in the original implementation, some kind of random sampling would be performed in the new implementation. This should be again controlled by parameters from generation config.
"""



# TODO:
# This needs to be re-implemented to:
# - use huggingface dataset instead of tsv files for intermediate steps
# - first generate full populated benchmark with all possible options, and after then randomly sample from the full
#   benchmark with desired settings
#       - desired percentage of NOTA-correct questions
#       - desired amount of (question-piece pairs)_per_skill 
# - generating full benchmark means:
#       - no sampling when generating questions from meta-questions
#       - generating NOTA-correct version for every question
# - subsampling at the end is then performed in the following setting:
#       - every question-piece that is selected, is selected in all submodalities
#       - number of question-piece pairs per skill is controlled
#           - but if the desired number exceeds the maximum possible number, the actual amount is kept lower  
#       - for each NOTA-correct version, the NOTA-incorrect question is also sampled
#       - this can be performed with different random seeds and different size settings, to obtain multiple different versions of the benchmark, both of the same size and differing in size
